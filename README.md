ParallelSVM
===========

To install, make sure you have the Microsoft version of MPI installed on your computer. 

You must get it here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb524831(v=vs.85).aspx. 

On that page you'll see links to download the appropriate MPI redistributable. At the time of writing this, 
the link for the redistributable to use went here:

...and was titled "HPC Pack 2012 MS-MPI Redistributable Package with Service Pack 1"
